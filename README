Description

This is a website for my wife's mobile grooming business. I wanted a 
responsive page that was easy to navigate.

Custom CSS Classes

The custom CSS clases I used are:
.name, .danipic, .mollypic - mainly used to float objects
.flex-container - used flexbox for our gallery
.col - used to create and style two columns for the About Us section.
also used - .wrapper, .under, .number, .about, .services, .pics, .lists

Custom IDs

The custom IDs I used were for the purpose of linking to parts of the 
page.
They are:
aboutus, ourgallery, contactus, pictures, service

Custom JavaScript

The JavaScript function I created is a for loop using mouseover and 
mouseout. It enlarges the navigation links and changes them to capital 
letters when hovered over and goes to lowercase when the cursor 
leaves.
